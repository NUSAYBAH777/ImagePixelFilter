# ImagePixelFilter
A C# WinForms application that demonstrates **pixel-by-pixel image processing** using `Bitmap.GetPixel` and `Bitmap.SetPixel`.  The app allows you to load two images and apply a color transformation effect either **step-by-step** or **automatically with animation**, making it useful for learning image processing basics and UI timers in WinForms.
